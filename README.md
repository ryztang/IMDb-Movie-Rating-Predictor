# IMDb-Movie-Rating-Predictor

A deep neural network that predicts a movie's IMDb rating based on its directors, writers, actors, actresses, genres, and release date.
There are three main components to this project: data preprocessing, model creation and training, and model prediction.

Below is a diagram of the data flow.
